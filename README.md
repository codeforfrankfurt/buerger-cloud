Buerger-Cloud

Keep your movement data private!

Instead of automatically sending movement data to your provider, you can store it
in the Buerger-Cloud and then give it (or part of it) to those providers you want.

This project was created to store data from mobile fine dust sensors via LoRaWAN
and to serve this data in anonymoud form to a frontend visualizing it.

It was created at the Global Open Data Hackathon in Frankfurt, Germany 2018.
